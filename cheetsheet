As the owner or root, execute the command

# chmod -R 700 /path/to/folder
The chmod command changes the permissions of the file/folder. The 700 means that the owner has full access, and no one else. The -r means to apply the rules recursively (through subfolders). You will also want to run a chown

# chown user:user -R /path/to/folder
The chown command changes the owner of the file/folder. The user: part is the username to apply the owner as; the :user part is for the group. Every user typically has it's own group as well. Again, the -R is to recurse through to subfolders
